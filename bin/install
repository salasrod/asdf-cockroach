# This script should install the version, in the path mentioned in ASDF_INSTALL_PATH.
#
# The install script should exit with a status of 0 when the installation is successful.
# If the installation fails the script should exit with any non-zero exit status.
#
# If possible the script should only place files in the ASDF_INSTALL_PATH directory once
# the build and installation of the tool is deemed successful by the install script.
# asdf checks for the existence of the ASDF_INSTALL_PATH directory in order to determine
# if that version of the tool is installed. If the ASDF_INSTALL_PATH directory is populated
# at the beginning of the installation process other asdf commands run in other terminals
# during the installation may consider that version of the tool installed,
# even when it is not fully installed.
